# Print Orders from History - Feature Implementation

## Overview
I have successfully implemented the ability to print old orders from the order history in the POS system. This feature allows users to reprint receipts for any previous order and view detailed information about past transactions.

## New Features Added

### 1. Print Order from History
- **Location**: Order History screen
- **Functionality**: Users can select any order from the history list and reprint its receipt
- **Format**: Generates the same professional PDF receipt as new orders

### 2. View Order Details
- **Location**: Order History screen  
- **Functionality**: Shows a detailed dialog with complete order information
- **Information Displayed**:
  - Order ID and timestamp
  - Cashier information
  - Payment method
  - Itemized list of products with quantities and prices
  - Subtotal, tax, discount, and total amounts
  - Option to reprint receipt from the details view

### 3. Enhanced Order History Interface
- **Visual Improvements**: Better layout with action buttons
- **User Experience**: Double-click to view details, dedicated buttons for actions
- **Selection**: Clear visual feedback for selected orders

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Database Layer (`database/db_manager.py`)
```python
def get_sale_by_id(self, sale_id: int) -> Optional[Sale]:
    """Get a specific sale by ID with complete information including items and payment."""
```
- Added method to retrieve complete sale information by ID
- Includes all sale items and payment details
- Returns None if sale not found

### 2. Language Support (`config/language_settings.py`)
Added new text keys for both French and Arabic:
- `print_order`: "Imprimer la commande" / "طباعة الطلب"
- `reprint_receipt`: "Réimprimer le reçu" / "إعادة طباعة الإيصال"
- `no_order_selected`: "Aucune commande sélectionnée" / "لم يتم اختيار أي طلب"
- `order_details`: "Détails de la commande" / "تفاصيل الطلب"
- `view_order`: "Voir la commande" / "عرض الطلب"
- `print_success`: "Impression réussie" / "تمت الطباعة بنجاح"
- `print_failed`: "Échec de l'impression" / "فشل في الطباعة"

### 3. GUI Implementation (`pos_system.py`)

#### New Methods Added:
```python
def print_order_from_history(self, sale_id: int):
    """Print an order from history using the advanced receipt printer."""

def show_order_details(self, sale_id: int):
    """Show detailed view of an order in a popup dialog."""

def create_order_details_dialog(self, sale: Sale):
    """Create a comprehensive order details dialog with print option."""
```

#### Enhanced Order History Interface:
- Added action buttons for "View Order" and "Reprint Receipt"
- Improved layout with dedicated space for buttons
- Better data handling with sales_data mapping for easy retrieval
- Double-click functionality to quickly view order details

## User Interface Flow

### Order Details Dialog:
1. Shows comprehensive order information
2. Displays all items with quantities and prices
3. Shows payment information and totals
4. Includes "Print Receipt" button for convenient reprinting
5. Close button to return to order history

## Error Handling
